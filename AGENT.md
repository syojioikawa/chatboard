# Communication Constraints and Guidelines

This document outlines the communication constraints and guidelines for our team to ensure effective and professional collaboration. 

## General Guidelines
- **Be Clear and Concise:** Always strive to express your ideas as clearly and directly as possible.
- **Respect Response Times:** Allow reasonable time for responses, especially for queries needing extensive consideration.
- **Use Appropriate Channels:** Choose the right platform for your message—chat for quick updates, email for formal communication, etc.

## Constraints
- **Avoid Over-Communication:** Resist the urge to send redundant messages, especially when a previous point is still under discussion.
- **Limit Long Messages:** Break up lengthy communications into digestible parts to keep others engaged and encourage response.

## Best Practices
- **Active Listening:** Always ensure that you understand others’ points before formulating your response.
- **Documentation:** Keep notes of key decisions and agreements to refer back to later.

Adhering to these guidelines will help us maintain a respectful and efficient communication environment.
